<p><b style ="color:crimson">Birth and Early Life of Shivaji</b> (1630-1645)<br>
    Shivaji Bhosale was born on February 19, 1630, in the hill fort of Shivneri, near Pune, to Shahaji Bhosale and Jijabai. His father, Shahaji, was a nobleman in the Deccan Sultanates, serving under the Adil Shahi and Mughal rulers, while his mother, Jijabai, was deeply spiritual and instilled in Shivaji the values of Hindu culture and the dream of Swarajya.
    
    Shivaji grew up in Pune under the guidance of his mother and his tutor, Dadoji Kondadev, who trained him in administration, warfare, and statecraft. From a young age, Shivaji displayed leadership qualities and a deep sense of/n

    Establishment of Swarajya
    At the tender age of 16, Shivaji began capturing forts around Pune, starting with Torna Fort in 1645. This marked the beginning of his vision for an independent Maratha kingdom. He continued to expand his territory by taking forts such as Purandar, Rajgad, and Kondhana, often using guerrilla warfare tactics, which later became his trademark strategy.
    
    Conflict with the Adil Shahi Sultanate
    The rise of Shivaji alarmed the Bijapur Sultanate, and in 1659, Adil Shah sent his general, Afzal Khan, to suppress him. Shivaji, known for his tactical brilliance, outwitted Afzal Khan during a face-to-face meeting at Pratapgad Fort, where he used his concealed tiger claws (wagh nakh) to kill the general, marking a significant victory for the Marathas.
    
    Encounter with the Mughals
    Shivaji’s growing power brought him into conflict with the mighty Mughal Empire. In 1665, Aurangzeb’s general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh, besieged Purandar Fort, forcing Shivaji to sign the Treaty of Purandar, surrendering several forts. However, Shivaji turned this setback into an opportunity. He later escaped from Agra in 1666 after being held captive by Aurangzeb and rebuilt his empire with renewed strength.

    On June 6, 1674, Shivaji was formally crowned as Chhatrapati (sovereign) of the Maratha Empire at Raigad Fort. The grand ceremony symbolized the establishment of Hindu self-rule in the Deccan after centuries of foreign domination. Shivaji implemented an efficient administration, a just taxation system, and built a formidable navy to protect the Konkan coast from foreign invaders.
    
    Military Campaigns and Administrative Reforms
    Shivaji’s military campaigns were marked by strategic brilliance and guerrilla warfare tactics known as Ganimi Kava. His forces successfully raided Mughal territories and expanded the Maratha Empire across Maharashtra, Karnataka, and parts of Tamil Nadu.

    Final Years and Legacy (1674-1680)
    Shivaji continued to expand his empire and resisted Mughal attempts to crush the Maratha power. However, his health began to decline, and on April 3, 1680, he passed away at Raigad Fort. His death left a huge void in the Maratha leadership, but his legacy remained an inspiration for generations to come.

    After Shivaji’s death, his elder son, Sambhaji Maharaj, took over the throne. Known for his courage and warrior spirit, Sambhaji faced relentless Mughal attacks led by Aurangzeb. Despite internal and external challenges, he fought valiantly to protect the Maratha kingdom.

    However, in 1689, he was captured by the Mughals and brutally executed for refusing to convert to Islam. His martyrdom further fueled the Maratha resistance, which eventually led to the empire’s resurgence under the leadership of his younger brother, Rajaram, and later the Peshwas.
